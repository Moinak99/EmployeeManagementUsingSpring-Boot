SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PARADIGM APPLIED:-
The Iterative Waterfall model is used here.
In the practical development fields there is a large number of errors in almost every
phase of the life cycle.
The source of the defects can be many:-
(i). Oversight,
(ii). Wrong assumptions,
(iii). Use of inappropriate technology,
(iv). Communication gap between the project engineers etc.
These defects usually get detected much later in life cycle.
For example design defect might go unnoticed till we reach the coding or testing
phase. Once a defect is detected the engineers need to go back to the phase where
the defect has occurred and redo some of the work done during that phase and the
subsequent phases to correct the defect and its effect on the later phase.
